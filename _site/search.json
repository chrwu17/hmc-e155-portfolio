    "text": "I took this course for a few reasons. First, I think that Hardware Engineering is a future career path for me, and something that I want to pursue long term. It is a good intersection between challenging problem solving that can impact billions of people around the world and my passion for electronics and computing. When I took E85 last year with Prof. Harris, I really enjoyed working on the labs, while sometimes challenging, it was really rewarding to see a project of mine come to fruition. I’ve chosen to take this course in my Junior year, in hopes that it will open up opportunities for internships in Hardware Engineeering. I would like to use my last summer of internships to be able to decide what career I would like to pursue after graduating from Mudd next year.\nThis semester, I would like to be able to absorb as much knowledge as I can, learning new techniques and ways to deal with software and hwardware. I think the nature of this class and the difficulty associated with it will also push me to learn some intangible skills that can be applied in my post-Mudd life. The tenacity and perseverance through challenging labs that aren’t going my way, and the ability to work more efficiently and under a time constraint to complete the labs on time every week will be valuable to being able to meet deadlines and tackle challenging real world problems in the industry.\nI look forward to a great semester of learning!"
