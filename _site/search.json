    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this lab is to use System Verilog to code a time-multiplexer to run both halves of my dual seven-segment display by switching between turning on the common anode of each display so that the naked eye cannot see the flickering of the two displays. To be able to supply the large current needed by the display, 2N3906 PNP transistors will be used. We will also use an adder to sum the two hexadecimal inputs from our dip switches and display that on five LEDs.\n\n\nDesign\n\nBlock Diagram\nMy approach to this lab consists on five different modules. It was designed to have many modules to make testing the functionality of each function of this lab easily. An overarching top level module called lab2_cw, which will be programmed to the board, and four submodules adder, sevenSegmentDisplay, timeMultiplexer, and sevenSegMux. The adder submodule will give the 5 bit sum of two four bit inputs, so that we can show the sum of our two inputs on five LEDS. The sevenSegmentDisplay submodule is the same one that was used in Lab 1, which will control the outputs on the 7-segment display, displaying the hexadecimal value provided by the dip switches, s1[3:0] and s2[3:0]. The timeMultiplexer submodule is responsible for controlling which common anode gets turned on in the dual 7-segment display. It was designed to switch at 500 Hz, which should be high enough to not be noticeable to the human eye. It will also output a signal to guide which input should be used by the sevenSegmentDisplay module, which is controlled by sevenSegMux. The sevenSegMux module is a mux that controls which four bit input will be fed into sevenSegmentDisplay based on the enable, signal, which is given by timeMultiplexer. The top level lab2_cw calls upon all these submodules as well as the HSOSC submodule, which takes advantage of the onboard 48 MHz clock on the FPGA. Below is the block diagram I used to create this project:\n\n\n\nLab 2 Block Diagram\n\n\n\n\nAdder Design\nThe adder submodule was a very simple design. It simply consisted of combinational logic that produced a 5 bit output, sum, from two four bit inputs, a and b.\nBelow is the code block that was used for this submodule:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/08/25\n\n// This module is a 4-bit adder that takes in two 4-bit inputs a and b, and outputs a 5-bit sum.\nmodule adder (\n    input logic [3:0] a, b,\n    output logic [4:0] sum);\n\n    always_comb begin\n        sum = a + b;\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nSeven Segment Display Design\nThis submodule is coopied from Lab 1 and uses the exact same code. Designing the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule was fairly simple. It involved using a case statement to write out the outputs, seg[6:0] of the 7-segment display for all 16 possible inputs of s[3:0]. While writing the code, it is worth noting that turning on each segment of the 7-segment display was with a 0 output as the cathode is connected to each output pin.\nBelow is a labeled image of each segment of the 7-segment display and the code for this submodule, where s[0] is segment A and s[6] is segment G of the 7-segment display:\n\n\n\n7-segment display segment mapping\n\n\n// sevenSegmentDisplay.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/06/25\n\n// This module takes in a 4-bit input 's', using the dip switches on the motherboard,\n// and controls the seven-segment display output seg[6:0].\nmodule lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay (\n    input logic [3:0] s,\n    output logic [6:0] seg);\n // 7-Segment Display Logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (s)\n            4'h0: seg = 7'b1000000; // 0\n            4'h1: seg = 7'b1111001; // 1\n            4'h2: seg = 7'b0100100; // 2\n            4'h3: seg = 7'b0110000; // 3\n            4'h4: seg = 7'b0011001; // 4\n            4'h5: seg = 7'b0010010; // 5\n            4'h6: seg = 7'b0000010; // 6\n            4'h7: seg = 7'b1111000; // 7\n            4'h8: seg = 7'b0000000; // 8\n            4'h9: seg = 7'b0010000; // 9\n            4'hA: seg = 7'b0001000; // A\n            4'hB: seg = 7'b0000011; // b\n            4'hC: seg = 7'b1000110; // C\n            4'hD: seg = 7'b0100001; // d\n            4'hE: seg = 7'b0000110; // E\n            4'hF: seg = 7'b0001110; // F\n            default: seg = 7'b1111111; // Off\n        endcase\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nTime Multiplexer Design\nThe main purpose of the timeMultiplexer submodule is to switch between each common anode on our dual 7-segment display, so that we only need one sevenSegmentDisplay submodule to control both digits. Thus, we are turning on one side of the dual 7-segment display on at a time, but if we do it fast enough, the human eye cannot notice each digit turning on and off. To switch between the two common anodes fast enough, I chose to switch between each display at 500 Hz. This is done by using the FPGA’s onboard 48 MHz clock, and using a counter. 500 Hz is equivalent to 0.002 seconds per cycle, and assuming a 50% duty cycle, we must switch from one common anode to the other every 0.001 seconds. For a 48 MHz clock, this would equate to 48000 ticks. Thus, we can use a counter to turn each side of the dual 7-segment display on or off, every 48000 ticks. At the same time, we can also output, signal, to tell the sevenSegMux submodule, which input to display on the corresponding side of the dual 7-segment display\nBelow is the code for the timeMultiplexer submodule:\n//  timeMultiplexer.sv\n//  Christian Wu\n//  chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n//  09/06/25\n\n// This module takes in two four bit inputs, s1 and s2, and switches between them to drive a dual seven\n// segment display, to utilize only one sevenSegmentDisplay module. The switching is done at a rate fast enough\n// such that the human eye cannot detect the switching, and it appears that both displays are on at the same time.\n\nmodule timeMultiplexer (\n    input clk,\n    output logic an1, an2,\n    output logic signal);\n\n    logic [24:0] counter = 0;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        counter &lt;= counter + 1;\n        if (counter == 48000) begin\n            counter &lt;= 0;\n            signal &lt;= ~signal; \n            if (~signal) begin\n                an1 &lt;= 1; // turn off an1\n                an2 &lt;= 0; // turn on an2\n            end else begin\n                an1 &lt;= 0; // turn on an1\n                an2 &lt;= 1; // turn off an2\n            end\n\n    end\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nSeven Segment Mux Design\nThe design for the sevenSegMux submodule is quite simple. This submodule depicts a simple mux with an enable on it. This submodule is used to output the correct 4 bit input into the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule. When the enable is on, we set the ouput to be s2, and when it is off, we set the output to be s1.\nBelow is the code for the sevenSegMux submodule:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/08/25\n\n// This module takes in two 4-bit inputs, s1 and s2, and an enable, and outputs one \n// of the inputs to a 4-bit output based on the enable signal for the seven-segment display\n\nmodule sevenSegMux (\n    input logic [3:0] s1, s2,\n    input logic enable,\n    output logic [3:0] out);\n\n    always_comb begin\n        if (enable) begin\n            out = s2;\n        end else begin\n            out = s1;\n        end\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nTop Level Module\nGiven that this lab project was split into one top level module and four submodules, the top level module is quite simple. It is a module that calls upon the four submodules, adder, sevenSegmentDisplay, timeMultiplexer, and sevenSegMux. It also calls upon the HSOSC module to take advantage of the onboard 48 MHz clock on the FPGA. This top level module, lab2_cw, will then be programmed onto the FPGA.\nBelow is the code for the top level module, lab2_cw:\n// lab2_cw.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/06/25\n\n// This module is the top level module for lab 2. It instantiates the timeMultiplexer module to drive the\n// seven-segment display, and connects the dip switches to the inputs of the timeMultiplexer module. It also displays\n// the sum of the two 4-bit inputs on five LEDs.\n\nmodule lab2_cw (\n    input logic [3:0] s1, s2, // dip switches\n    output logic [6:0] seg, // seven-segment display\n    output logic an1, an2, // anodes for the two displays\n    output logic [4:0] sum); // 5 LEDs to display sum\n\n    \n    logic [3:0] sevenSegmentSignal;\n    logic signal; // select signal to choose between s1 and s2\n    logic clk;\n    \n    HSOSC hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(clk));\n    timeMultiplexer tm (.clk(clk), .an1(an1), .an2(an2), .signal(signal));\n    sevenSegMux ssm (.s1(s1[3:0]), .s2(s2[3:0]), .enable(signal), .out(sevenSegmentSignal));\n    sevenSegmentDisplay ssd (.s(sevenSegmentSignal), .seg(seg));\n    adder a (.a(s1[3:0]), .b(s2[3:0]), .sum(sum[4:0]));\nendmodule\n\n\n\nTestbench Simulation and Testing\n\nTestbench Design and Results\nTo test my code and see whether it would work as expected, I created a testbench to test before moving on to using physical hardware. I created a testbench for each of my five modules, testing a different functionality of this lab with east testbench. For the adder submodule, I tested all 256 possible cases using a for loop to make sure that the output sum was correct. For the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule, I tested all 16 possible 4 bit inputs and made sure that the 7 bit output was correct. For the timeMultiplexer submodule, I tested the sequential logic that occurs in this submodule to check that the submodule switches between turning on each common anode on the dual 7-segment display, and correctly outputs the right signal for the sevenSegMux to use. For the sevenSegMux submodule, I tested that the mux would output the right 4 bit value from the two 4 bit inputs, based on whether the enable was on or off. For the top level lab2_cw module, it was used to test that the HSOSC module worked, by sampling a few different test cases and making sure that the dual 7-segment display would show both of the values by switching between outputting each one.\nEach of the testbenches were done by using the stim/assert method, to ensure functionality automatically, without having to analyze the waveforms carefully to see if it worked or not.\n\nadder_testbench results:\nThis testbench tested the combinational logic of the adder submodule, testing all 256 cases.

After referencing the HDSP-521A Seven Segment Display Datasheet, I found that the forward voltage for the display is 2 V. Given that we are using a 3.3 V source voltage from the FPGA, the voltage across the resistor is 1.3 V. It is safe for the 7-segment display’s pins to be around 10-20 mA, so to keep it clean, I used 100 Ohm Resistors, giving a current of 13 mA.\n2N3906 Transistor Base Resistor Value\nWe are supplying 3.3 V to our 2N3906 PNP Transistor. We know from the data sheetthat the Base Emitter Voltage is around 0.7, so we have 2.6 V that will be dropped through the resistor that connects the base to the GPIO Pin. From the iice40 Datasheet, we know from Table 4.17 that I_OL = 8 mA. Thus, we know that we want the current to be between 1 and 8 mA. I chose to use a 1 k Ohm resistor, which gives a current of 2.6 mA, giving ample wiggle room on both ends. Below is a picture that models this math:\n\n\n\nTransistor Resistor Value Math\n\n\nLED Resistor Values\nThe forward voltage of our yellow LEDs is around 2V, and we know that the current through the LEDs should be under 20 mA. Given that we are supplying 3.3 V, the remaining voltage drop across our resistor would be 1.3 V. I chose to use a 100 Ohm resistor, which gives me a current of 13 mA, keeping the LED bright, but under the 20 mA max.\n\n\nResults\nAfter finishing with the design, I was able to wire my board according to the schematic and programming my top level module, lab2_cw, onto my board. I was able to physically verify that everything worked as expected.\nBelow are a few pictures demonstrating this lab working successfully:\n\n\n\ns1 = 6; s2 = 3; sum = 9\n\n\n\n\n\ns1 = F; s2 = 8; sum = 23\n\n\n\n\n\ns1 = 0; s2 = 5; sum = 5\n\n\nAs a result, my design and project has met all the requirements for this lab."

Claude was able to synthesize properly and it seems like it would actually work quite well, which is really impressive. By slightly modifying this code and adapting it for the purposes of this lab, it would be able to work successfully.\n\n\n\nPrompt 2\nI then ran the second prompt by also giving my lab 1 files as a sample to base off of. I used the following prompt:\nWrite SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits.

I also assigned pins and programmed the code onto my board and it worked successfully.\n\n\n\nReflection\nI am overall very impressed with how AI performed. I was able to run the code on my board and get it to work as expected, showing the power of using AI to write quick and effective code. I learned that Claude is able to write much cleaner code than me, avoiding redundancies and having everything fit in just one module. While this is helpful here, it might not be helpful for testbenching purposes, but I think if I gave AI the right prompts, it would modify my code to make it more testbench friendly and also write the testbenches for me.\nWhat I learned here, as well as with the AI prototype of Lab 1 is that if we guide the AI to where we want it to be, it will be able to achieve what we want. If we don’t guide it at all, it will do a fairly good job, but it won’t work and it won’t be perfect. But if we guide it in the right direction, it will be able to correct those small details that are wrong and be able to run correctly on the board.\nOnce again, I am very impressed with Claude and I can see how useful it will be for the final project."

On my personal laptop, the Programmer software would crash everytime I clicked the ‘detect cable button’, and on the lab computers, I would get an FTDI error when uploading code to the FPGA. I was unable to fix this issue for around 3 days, until a new programming method was uploaded (Thank you Kavi!). Thus, I followed the openFPGALoader Programmer Tutorial and was able to successfully program my FPGA. This allowed me to finish the tutorial and successfully see the onboard LED D6 at P42 blinking.\nI continued to do further testing on the FPGA as well as the MCU, I downloaded test code from the course Lab 1 Github Repo and programmed onto my board. After running the code on both my FPGA and MCU, I saw that when I had SW7 switched on, LED D3 (PA9/P25), LED D2 (PA10/P23), and LED D7 (P38) were all blinking.\nThis means that I have successfully tested by development board, FPGA, and MCU, so I know that all my components are working as expected."

    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nObjective\nNow that testing the development board, FPGA, and MCU is complete, we can start working on the lab. The objective of this lab is to take inputs, s[3:0], which are the four DIP switches on SW6, and use them to drive three onboard LEDs, led[2:0], and display the hexadecimal digit of our inputs on a 7-segment display, seg[6:0]. The inputs and outputs are described by the following table:\n\n\n\nSignal Name\nSignal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns[3:0]\ninput\nthe four DIP switches (on the board, SW6)\n\n\nled[2:0]\noutput\n3 LEDs (you may use the on-board LEDs)\n\n\nseg[6:0]\noutput\nthe segments of a common-anode 7-segment display\n\n\n\nThe output of led[2] will be programmed to blink at 2.4 Hz, while the outputs of led[1:0] can be described by the following table:\n\n\n\n\ns1\ns0\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nOFF\n\n\n0\n1\nON\n\n\n1\n0\nON\n\n\n1\n1\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns3\ns2\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nOFF\n\n\n0\n1\nOFF\n\n\n1\n0\nOFF\n\n\n1\n1\nON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nBlock Diagram\nMy approach to this lab consists on three different modules. An overarching top level module called lab1_cw, which will be programmed to the board, and two submodules lab1_ledController, and lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay. The lab1_ledController submodule will control the output of each LED, utilizing the HSOSC library to control led[2], and utilizing simple logic to control led[1:0]. The lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay submodule will control the outputs on the 7-segment display, displaying the hexadecimal value provided by the dip switches, s[3:0]. The lab1_cw module will call both the lab1_ledController submodule and the lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay submodule to run on the board. Below is the block diagram I used to create this project:\n\n\n\nLab 1 Block Diagram\n\n\n\n\nLED Design\nDesign for the lab1_ledController submodule was split into two components, designing the logic for led[1:0] based on inputs s[3:0], and making led[2] blink at 2.4 Hz.\nDesigning the logic for led[1:0] was fairly simple, based on the patterns formed from the table above. Inputs s1 and s0 control the output of led[0]. From the table, led[0] is formed by an XOR gate with inputs s1 and s0.\nInputs s3 and s2 control the output of led[1]. From the table, led[1] is formed by an AND gate, with inputs s3 and s2.\nDesigning led[2] to blink at 2.4 Hz was a bit more challenging. To run at 2.4 Hz, every full cycle of the LED should be around 0.4167 seconds per cycle. Given that the LED is on or off for only half a cycle, which is also known as a 50% duty cycle, the LED needs to change state every half cycle, or every 0.2083 seconds. The HSOSC oscillator runs at 48 MHz. So in order for us to change states at every 0.2083 seconds, the clock will need to tick 10,000,000 times. This is done using a counter, which at every 10 million clock ticks of the HSOSC oscillator, will change the state of the LED from on to off or vice versa.\nBelow is the code block that was used for this submodule:\n// lab1_ledController.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 08/31/25\n\n// This module takes in a 4-bit input 's', using the dip switches on the motherboard,\n// and controls a 3-bit LED output led[2:0], which are the SMD LEDs on the motherboard.\n\nmodule lab1_ledController (\n    input logic [3:0] s,\n    output logic [2:0] led\n);\n\n// LED Logic for led[0] and led[1]\n    xor led0_logic(led[0], s[0], s[1]);\n    and led1_logic(led[1], s[2], s[3]);\n\n    // LED Logic for led[2] to blink at 2.4 Hz\n    logic int_osc;\n    logic led_state = 0;\n    logic [24:0] counter = 0;\n    \n    // Internal high-speed oscillator\n    HSOSC hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(int_osc));\n    \n    // Simple clock divider\n    always_ff @(posedge int_osc)\n        begin\n            counter &lt;= counter + 1;\n            if (counter == 10_000_000) begin // Adjust this value for 2.4 Hz\n                led_state &lt;= ~led_state;\n                counter &lt;= 0;\n            end\n        end\n    //assign led[2] to blink state    \n    assign led[2] = led_state;\n\nendmodule\n\n\nSeven Segment Display Design\nDesigning the lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay submodule was fairly simple. It involved using a case statement to write out the outputs, seg[6:0] of the 7-segment display for all 16 possible inputs of s[3:0]. While writing the code, it is worth noting that turning on each segment of the 7-segment display was with a 0 output as the cathode is connected to each output pin.\nBelow is a labeled image of each segment of the 7-segment display and the code for this submodule, where s[0] is segment A and s[6] is segment G of the 7-segment display:\n\n\n\n7-segment display segment mapping\n\n\n// lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 08/31/25\n\n// This module takes in a 4-bit input 's', using the dip switches on the motherboard,\n// and controls the seven-segment display output seg[6:0].\nmodule lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay (\n    input logic [3:0] s,\n    output logic [6:0] seg);\n // 7-Segment Display Logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (s)\n            4'h0: seg = 7'b1000000; // 0\n            4'h1: seg = 7'b1111001; // 1\n            4'h2: seg = 7'b0100100; // 2\n            4'h3: seg = 7'b0110000; // 3\n            4'h4: seg = 7'b0011001; // 4\n            4'h5: seg = 7'b0010010; // 5\n            4'h6: seg = 7'b0000010; // 6\n            4'h7: seg = 7'b1111000; // 7\n            4'h8: seg = 7'b0000000; // 8\n            4'h9: seg = 7'b0010000; // 9\n            4'hA: seg = 7'b0001000; // A\n            4'hB: seg = 7'b0000011; // b\n            4'hC: seg = 7'b1000110; // C\n            4'hD: seg = 7'b0100001; // d\n            4'hE: seg = 7'b0000110; // E\n            4'hF: seg = 7'b0001110; // F\n            default: seg = 7'b1111111; // Off\n        endcase\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nTop Level Module\nGiven that this lab project was split into one top level module and two submodules, the top level module is quite simple. It is a module that calls upon the two submodules, lab1_ledController and lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay. This top level module, lab1_cw, will then be programmed onto the FPGA.\nBelow is the code for the top level module, lab1_cw:\n// lab1_cw.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 08/31/25\n\n// This module takes in a 4-bit input 's', using the dip switches on the motherboard,  \n// and controls a 3-bit LED output led[2:0], which are the SMD LEDs on the motherboard, \n// and a 7-segment display output seg[6:0].\nmodule lab1_cw (\n    input logic [3:0] s,\n    output logic [2:0] led,\n    output logic [6:0] seg\n);\n    // call led controller module\n    lab1_ledController led_ctrl (.s(s), .led(led));\n    // call seven segment display module\n    lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay seg_ctrl (.s(s), .seg(seg));\n\nendmodule\n\n\n\nTestbench Simulation and Testing\n\nTestbench and Test Vector Design\nTo test my code and see whether it would work as expected, I created a testbench to test before moving on to using physical hardware. I created a testbench of each of my three modules. For the top level module, lab1_cw, I tested that the LED and 7-segment display outputs would be correct based on the dip switch input. For the lab1_ledController submodule, I tested just the LED outputs with the dip switch input. For the lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay submodule, I tested just the 7-segment display output with the dip switch input. For both the lab1_cw module and the lab1_ledController submodule, I omitted led[2] from the testbench and test vectors as it is blinking at 2.4 Hz.\nTo know what we are testing against, there are test vectors associated with each testbench, showing the expected outputs that will be compared against the actual outputs given by the code. To avoid redundancy, I am only attaching the top level lab1_cw test vectors testbench, as it covers what is included in the testbenches of both submodules. The testbenches for my other modules can be found in my Lab 1 GitHub Repo\nBelow are the test vectors I used for the lab1_cw_testbench:\n// lab1_cw_testvectors.tv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 08/31/25\n\n// Test vectors to use in my testbench file, lab1_cw_testbench.sv, \n// to simulate LED and 7 segment display\n\n// Test vector format:\n// s[3:0]_LED[1:0]_seg[6:0]\n// led[2] is excluded because it blinks at 2.4 Hz, so it will be tested on an oscilloscope\n\n0000_00_1000000\n0001_01_1111001\n0010_01_0100100\n0011_00_0110000\n0100_00_0011001\n0101_01_0010010\n0110_01_0000010\n0111_00_1111000\n1000_00_0000000\n1001_01_0010000\n1010_01_0001000\n1011_00_0000011\n1100_10_1000110\n1101_11_0100001\n1110_11_0000110\n1111_10_0001110\nBelow is the code for the testbench used for lab1_cw:\n// lab1_cw_testbench.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 08/31/25\n\n// This is a testbench to test my lab 1 code (lab1_cw.sv).\n// It tests the LED logic and 7-segment display logic based on different 4-bit inputs.\n\n`timescale 1ns/1ns\n`default_nettype none\n`define N_TV 16\n\nmodule lab1_cw_testbench();\n\nlogic clk;\nlogic reset;\n\nlogic [3:0] s;\nlogic [2:0] led;\nlogic [1:0] led_expected;\nlogic [6:0] seg, seg_expected;\nlogic [31:0] vectornum, errors;\nlogic [12:0] testvectors[10000:0]; // s[3:0]_led[1:0]_seg[6:0]\n\n// Instantiate the device under test (DUT)\nlab1_cw dut (.s(s), .led(led), .seg(seg));\n\n// generate clock\nalways begin\n    clk = 1; #5; clk = 0; #5;\nend\n\n// Load test vectors, and pulse reset\ninitial begin\n    $readmemb(\"lab1_cw_testvectors.tv\", testvectors, 0, `N_TV-1);\n    vectornum = 0; errors = 0;\n    reset = 1; #27; reset = 0;\nend\n\n// Apply test vectors at rising edge of clock\nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    #1; {s, led_expected, seg_expected} = testvectors[vectornum];\nend\ninitial\nbegin\n    // Create dumpfile for signals\n    $dumpfile(\"lab1_cw_testbench.vcd\");\n    $dumpvars(0, lab1_cw_testbench);\nend\n\n// Check results on falling edge of clock\nalways @(negedge clk) begin\n    if (~reset) begin\n        if (led[1:0] != led_expected || seg != seg_expected) begin\n            $display(\"Error at vector %0d: s=%b, led=%b (expected %b), seg=%b (expected %b)\", \n                     vectornum, s, led[1:0], led_expected, seg, seg_expected);\n            errors = errors + 1;\n        end\n        vectornum = vectornum + 1;\n        if (vectornum &gt;= `N_TV) begin\n            $display(\"%0d tests completed with %0d errors\", vectornum, errors);\n            $stop;\n        end\n    end\nend\nendmodule\nSomething that I had trouble with on this testbench was getting it to output the message that says the tests completed with 0 errors. When I used if (testvectors[vectornum] === 13'bx) to stop the simulation and display the message, no message would display. Thus, I checked whether vectornum reached the number of test vectors I had and would stop the simulation. This method worked, however, I want to figure out why the other method would not work.\n\n\nTestbench Results\nI was able to simulate each of my modules in Questa and it successfully worked, meaning that the outputs of my modules matched the expected output depicted by my test vectors. Below are the waveforms for each of my module’s testbenches.\n\nlab1_ledController_testbench results (only testing led[1] and led[0]):\n\n\n\nlab1_ledController Waveforms\n\n\n\n\n\nlab1_ledController Transcript\n\n\nIn addition to the testbench for the LEDs, I also used an oscilloscope to confirm that led[2] is blinking at 2.4 Hz. The oscilloscope trace can be seen below:\n\n\n\nOscilloscope trace showing led[2] blinking at 2.4 Hz\n\n\n\n\nlab1_sevenSegmentDisplay_testbench results:\n\n\n\nlab1_sevenSegmentDisplay Waveforms\n\n\n\n\n\nlab1_sevenSegmentDisplay Transcript\n\n\n\n\nlab1_cw_testbench results (top level module including LED and 7-segment display output):\n\n\n\nlab1_cw Waveforms\n\n\n\n\n\nlab1_cw Transcript\n\n\nThus, all testbenches and testing for this lab was successful!\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\nDesign and Schematic\nAfter finishing with testing, I can now build my hardware and program my FPGA.

After referencing the HDSP-511A Seven Segment Display Datasheet, I found that the forward voltage for the display is 2 V. Given that we are using a 3.3 V source voltage from the FPGA, the voltage across the resistor is 1.3 V. It is safe for the 7-segment display’s pins to be around 10-20 mA, so to keep it clean, I used 100 Ohm Resistors, giving a current of 13 mA.\n\n\nResults\nAfter finishing with the design, I was able to wire my board according to the schematic and programming my top level module, lab1_cw, onto my board. Since the lab ran out of ribbon cables, I used female to male jumper cables to connect my FPGA from the development board to my breadboard. I was able to physically verify that everything worked as expected. I used the oscilloscope to confirm that led[2] was blinking at 2.4 Hz, and the 7-segment display was able to display all 16 hexadecimal inputs. led[1:0] were also able to light up as expected based on the inputs s[3:0].\nBelow are pictures demonstrating all 16 hexadecimal values on my 7-segment display:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’h9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Segment Display showing 1’hF\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a picture demonstrating led[1] being on when s[3] and s[2] is on, and led[0] being on with only s[1] being on.\n\n\n\nPicture showing led[1] and led[0] on based on s[3:0] inputs\n\n\nAs a result, my design and project has met all the requirements for this lab."

Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.\n\n\nAI Code\nAs a result, it returned the following code:\n// SystemVerilog LED Blinker for Lattice UP5K FPGA\n// Uses internal 48MHz oscillator to blink LED at 2Hz\n// Takes advantage of SystemVerilog features like logic, always_ff, etc.\n\nmodule led_blinker_up5k (\n    output logic led\n);\n\n    // Internal oscillator clock signal\n    logic clk_48mhz;\n    \n    // Counter for frequency division\n    // Need to divide 48MHz by 12M to get 4Hz toggle (2Hz blink)\n    // 12M = 12_000_000 requires 24 bits (2^24 = 16,777,216)\n    localparam int COUNTER_MAX = 12_000_000 - 1;\n    logic [23:0] counter;\n    \n    // LED output register\n    logic led_reg;\n    \n    // Instantiate the internal high-frequency oscillator\n    // SB_HFOSC is the Lattice UP5K primitive for the internal oscillator\n    SB_HFOSC #(\n        .CLKHF_DIV(\"0b00\")  // 48MHz (divide by 1)\n    ) hfosc_inst (\n        .CLKHFPU(1'b1),     // Power up the oscillator\n        .CLKHFEN(1'b1),     // Enable the oscillator\n        .CLKHF(clk_48mhz)   // 48MHz clock output\n    );\n    \n    // Counter logic using SystemVerilog always_ff\n    always_ff @(posedge clk_48mhz) begin\n        if (counter &gt;= COUNTER_MAX) begin\n            counter &lt;= '0;\n            led_reg &lt;= ~led_reg;  // Toggle LED every 0.25 seconds\n        end else begin\n            counter &lt;= counter + 1'b1;\n        end\n    end\n    \n    // Assign LED output\n    assign led = led_reg;\n\nendmodule\n\n\nTest in Radiant\nI then started a new project in Radiant and attempted to synthesize the code. It was unable to synthesize due to the following error:\nERROR &lt;35901063&gt; - c:/users/chris/onedrive/desktop/wu-e155-lab1/lab1_cw_aiprototype/source/impl_1/led_blinker_up5k.sv(29): instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC. VERI-1063\n\nchild process exited abnormally\nDone: error code 1\nClaude AI proceded to make some changes but after synthesizing, it still returned the same error.\n\n\nReflection\nAfter comparing my code to the one that Claude produced, I was able to see the potential of coding with AI. Claude got everything in the module correct with the exception of the HSOSC part. Although this is the most important part and Claude got it wrong, it was very close to being right, and small tweaks and guidance in the right direction on to properly use the HSOSC library would result in code that would work.\nI like how clean the syntax of Claude is, and the variable names are informative. The added comments are also quite helpful to understand the logic and structure of the code. With some support on the library, coding with an AI can be very powerful, as it is able to do the bulk of the work for us quickly and efficiently. Small tweaks for more nuanced things like specific libraries is a reasonable fix for me and an easy one to do, to be able to take advantage of the power of AI for the rest of the code. To do this, I could either change the code manually, or create more specific prompts to tell it how to use the library in a way that will work.\nOverall, I am very impressed with how well it worked, and I see a lot of potential for it to be used for the final project."

    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this lab is to build upon the work done in Lab 2, by adding the addition of a keypad for inputs. This brings an additional layer of complexity, by making sure that we synchronize asynchronous outputs, eliminate switch bouncing, and making sure that buttons are only registered once.\n\n\nDesign\n\nSynchronizing asynchronous inputs\nMetastability occurs with this keypad when key inputs occur too close to a rising edge of the clock, causing asynchrony. To fix this, we can use a two stage synchronizer, which involves using two flip flops to synchronize our keypad input and have a stable input going into the FSM. This is done in this lab by synchronizing my column inputs, with the synchronizer module.\n\n\nAccounting for switch bouncing\nAll mechanical switches have a phenomenom called switch bouncing, where the input signals by the switch oscillate quickly between on and off as the button is getting clicked. This occurs until the button is fully clicked and the input signal becomes stable. To account for this and not read mistake one key press for multiple key presses, I used SystemVerilog code to add a delay between reading inputs in my FSM. This will prevent a single key input being mistaken as multiple inputs.\n\n\nBlock Diagram\nMy approach to this lab consists of eight different modules. It was designed to have many modules to make testing the functionality of each function of this lab easily. An overarching top level module called lab3_cw, which will be programmed to the board, and seven submodules synchronizer, keypadFSM, keypad, sevenSegDigits, timeMultiplexer, sevenSegMux and sevenSegDisplay. The synchronizer submodule will synchronize my keypad inputs using a simple two stage synchronizer with two flip flops. The keypadFSM submodule is an FSM that controls how to detect keypad presses and what to do with it. It also implements switch debouncing. The keypad submodule helps decode what number corresponds to each row and column on the 4 x 4 keypad. The sevenSegDigits submodule is responsible for shifting the digits on the dual 7-segment display based on what the FSM tells it to do. The timeMultiplexer submodule is the same as in lab 2, and is responsible for controlling which common anode gets turned on in the dual 7-segment display. The sevenSegMux submodule is the same as in lab 2, and is a mux that controls which four bit input will be fed into sevenSegmentDisplay based on the enable, signal, which is given by timeMultiplexer. The sevenSegmentDisplay submodule is the same one that was used in Lab 1 and 2, which will control the outputs on the 7-segment display, displaying the hexadecimal value provided by the dip switches, s1[3:0] and s2[3:0]. It was designed to switch at 500 Hz, which should be high enough to not be noticeable to the human eye. It will also output a signal to guide which input should be used by the sevenSegmentDisplay module, which is controlled by sevenSegMux. The top level lab3_cw calls upon all these submodules as well as the HSOSC submodule, which takes advantage of the onboard 48 MHz clock on the FPGA. Below is the block diagram I used to create this project:\n\n\n\nLab 3 Block Diagram\n\n\n\n\nsynchronizer Design\nThe synchronizer submodule was a very simple design. It consisted of a two stage synchronizer by utilizing two flip flops to synchronize our asynchronous inputs.\nBelow is the code block that was used for this submodule:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/13/25\n\n// This module is a simple two-stage synchronizer to safely bring an asynchronous input signal\n// into the clock domain of the provided clock signal. This helps to prevent metastability issues.\n\nmodule synchronizer (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [3:0] in,\n    output logic [3:0] out);\n\n    logic [3:0] mid;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            mid &lt;= 4'b0000;\n            out &lt;= 4'b0000;\n        end else begin\n        mid &lt;= in;\n        out &lt;= mid;\n    end\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nKeypad FSM Design\nThe FSM was designed to have 12 states. In order to detect key presses, I would rotate between scanning each row, one at a time until detecting a key input. Then it would move into the debounce state where it would have a 50 ms delay for debouncing, and then go to the hold state if the input is stable.\nSome mechanical switches only bounce for 10 - 20 ms, so my debouncing method accounts for all of it and makes sure that keys are debounced. However, tradeoffs for this is that responses might be slow due to the long debounce time and the slow time between moving state to state, which goes at 1 kHz. But for the purposes of this lab, it seems pretty reasonable to go at 50 ms, since we cannot really exploit the long debounce times as it is not noticeable to the human eye and reaction speed. Another limitation is the need for an extra four states for debouncing. Right now, I am utilizing 4 bits of state, while only using 12 states, so I am wasting 4 states. If I did not have 4 bits of debouncing state, I could use just 3 bits of state and fully utilize it.\nHere is my FSM State Transition Diagram:\n\n\n\nFSM State Transition Diagram\n\n\nHere is a state transition table for switching states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent State\nCondition\nNext State\n\n\n\n\nS0\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed\nS4\n\n\nS0\n!(buttonPressed && oneButtonPressed)\nS1\n\n\nS1\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed\nS6\n\n\nS1\n!(buttonPressed && oneButtonPressed)\nS2\n\n\nS2\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed\nS8\n\n\nS2\n!(buttonPressed && oneButtonPressed)\nS3\n\n\nS3\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed\nS10\n\n\nS3\n!(buttonPressed && oneButtonPressed)\nS0\n\n\nS4\n!buttonPressed || !oneButtonPressed\nS1\n\n\nS4\ncounter &gt;= 50\nS5\n\n\nS4\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed && counter &lt; 50\nS4\n\n\nS5\n!originalStillPressed\nS1\n\n\nS5\noriginalStillPressed\nS5\n\n\nS6\n!buttonPressed || !oneButtonPressed\nS2\n\n\nS6\ncounter &gt;= 50\nS7\n\n\nS6\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed && counter &lt; 50\nS6\n\n\nS7\n!originalStillPressed\nS2\n\n\nS7\noriginalStillPressed\nS7\n\n\nS8\n!buttonPressed || !oneButtonPressed\nS3\n\n\nS8\ncounter &gt;= 50\nS9\n\n\nS8\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed && counter &lt; 50\nS8\n\n\nS9\n!originalStillPressed\nS3\n\n\nS9\noriginalStillPressed\nS9\n\n\nS10\n!buttonPressed || !oneButtonPressed\nS0\n\n\nS10\ncounter &gt;= 50\nS11\n\n\nS10\nbuttonPressed && oneButtonPressed && counter &lt; 50\nS10\n\n\nS11\n!originalStillPressed\nS0\n\n\nS11\noriginalStillPressed\nS11\n\n\n\nHere is a state transition table for my outputs:\n\n\n\nState Group\nrow Output\nen Signal\nrc Output\n\n\n\n\nS0, S4, S5\n4’b0001\n1 when S4→S5\n{rowPressed, col}\n\n\nS1, S6, S7\n4’b0010\n1 when S6→S7\n{rowPressed, col}\n\n\nS2, S8, S9\n4’b0100\n1 when S8→S9\n{rowPressed, col}\n\n\nS3, S10, S11\n4’b1000\n1 when S10→S11\n{rowPressed, col}\n\n\n\nHere is the code for this submodule:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/15/25\n\n// This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to scan a 4x4 keypad.\n// It drives the rows and reads the columns to detect key presses, with\n// debouncing and single key press detection.

The main purpose of the timeMultiplexer submodule is to switch between each common anode on our dual 7-segment display, so that we only need one sevenSegmentDisplay submodule to control both digits. Thus, we are turning on one side of the dual 7-segment display on at a time, but if we do it fast enough, the human eye cannot notice each digit turning on and off. To switch between the two common anodes fast enough, I chose to switch between each display at 500 Hz. This is done by using the FPGA’s onboard 48 MHz clock, and using a counter. 500 Hz is equivalent to 0.002 seconds per cycle, and assuming a 50% duty cycle, we must switch from one common anode to the other every 0.001 seconds. For a 48 MHz clock, this would equate to 48000 ticks. Thus, we can use a counter to turn each side of the dual 7-segment display on or off, every 48000 ticks. At the same time, we can also output, signal, to tell the sevenSegMux submodule, which input to display on the corresponding side of the dual 7-segment display\nBelow is the code for the timeMultiplexer submodule:\n//  timeMultiplexer.sv\n//  Christian Wu\n//  chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n//  09/06/25\n\n// This module takes in two four bit inputs, s1 and s2, and switches between them to drive a dual seven\n// segment display, to utilize only one sevenSegmentDisplay module. The switching is done at a rate fast enough\n// such that the human eye cannot detect the switching, and it appears that both displays are on at the same time.\n\nmodule timeMultiplexer (\n    input clk,\n    output logic an1, an2,\n    output logic signal);\n\n    logic [24:0] counter = 0;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        counter &lt;= counter + 1;\n        if (counter == 48000) begin\n            counter &lt;= 0;\n            signal &lt;= ~signal; \n            if (~signal) begin\n                an1 &lt;= 1; // turn off an1\n                an2 &lt;= 0; // turn on an2\n            end else begin\n                an1 &lt;= 0; // turn on an1\n                an2 &lt;= 1; // turn off an2\n            end\n\n    end\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nSeven Segment Mux Design\nThe design for the sevenSegMux submodule is quite simple. This submodule depicts a simple mux with an enable on it. This submodule is used to output the correct 4 bit input into the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule. When the enable is on, we set the ouput to be s2, and when it is off, we set the output to be s1.\nBelow is the code for the sevenSegMux submodule:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/08/25\n\n// This module takes in two 4-bit inputs, s1 and s2, and an enable, and outputs one \n// of the inputs to a 4-bit output based on the enable signal for the seven-segment display\n\nmodule sevenSegMux (\n    input logic [3:0] s1, s2,\n    input logic enable,\n    output logic [3:0] out);\n\n    always_comb begin\n        if (enable) begin\n            out = s2;\n        end else begin\n            out = s1;\n        end\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nSeven Segment Display Design\nThis submodule is copied from Lab 1 and uses the exact same code. Designing the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule was fairly simple. It involved using a case statement to write out the outputs, seg[6:0] of the 7-segment display for all 16 possible inputs of s[3:0]. While writing the code, it is worth noting that turning on each segment of the 7-segment display was with a 0 output as the cathode is connected to each output pin.\nBelow is a labeled image of each segment of the 7-segment display and the code for this submodule, where s[0] is segment A and s[6] is segment G of the 7-segment display:\n\n\n\n7-segment display segment mapping\n\n\n// sevenSegmentDisplay.sv\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/06/25\n\n// This module takes in a 4-bit input 's', using the dip switches on the motherboard,\n// and controls the seven-segment display output seg[6:0].\nmodule lab1_sevenSegmentDisplay (\n    input logic [3:0] s,\n    output logic [6:0] seg);\n // 7-Segment Display Logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (s)\n            4'h0: seg = 7'b1000000; // 0\n            4'h1: seg = 7'b1111001; // 1\n            4'h2: seg = 7'b0100100; // 2\n            4'h3: seg = 7'b0110000; // 3\n            4'h4: seg = 7'b0011001; // 4\n            4'h5: seg = 7'b0010010; // 5\n            4'h6: seg = 7'b0000010; // 6\n            4'h7: seg = 7'b1111000; // 7\n            4'h8: seg = 7'b0000000; // 8\n            4'h9: seg = 7'b0010000; // 9\n            4'hA: seg = 7'b0001000; // A\n            4'hB: seg = 7'b0000011; // b\n            4'hC: seg = 7'b1000110; // C\n            4'hD: seg = 7'b0100001; // d\n            4'hE: seg = 7'b0000110; // E\n            4'hF: seg = 7'b0001110; // F\n            default: seg = 7'b1111111; // Off\n        endcase\n    end\nendmodule\n\n\nTop Level Module\nGiven that this lab project was split into one top level module and seven submodules, the top level module is quite simple. It is a module that calls upon the seven submodules synchronizer, keypadFSM, keypad, sevenSegDigits, timeMultiplexer, sevenSegMux and sevenSegDisplay. It also calls upon the HSOSC module to take advantage of the onboard 48 MHz clock on the FPGA. This top level module, lab2_cw, will then be programmed onto the FPGA.\nBelow is the code for the top level module, lab3_cw:\n// Christian Wu\n// chrwu@g.hmc.edu\n// 09/13/25\n\n// This is the top level module for Lab 3. This module will display the last two hexadecimal digits pressed\n// on the seven segment display. Simplified to use single clock with proper timing.\n\nmodule lab3_cw (\n    input logic resetInv, \n    input logic [3:0] col,\n    output logic [3:0] row,\n    output logic [6:0] seg,\n    output logic an1, an2);\n\n    logic clk;         \n    logic reset;\n    logic [7:0] rc;\n    logic [3:0] col_sync;\n    logic [3:0] key;\n    logic en;\n    logic [3:0] s1, s2;\n    logic signal;\n    logic [3:0] current_seg;       \n    \n    assign reset = ~resetInv;\n\n    HSOSC hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(clk));\n    synchronizer sync (.clk(clk), .reset(reset), .in(col), .out(col_sync));\n    keypadFSM fsm (.clk(clk), .reset(reset), .col(col_sync), .row(row), .rc(rc), .en(en));\n    keypad keypad_decode (.row(rc[7:4]), .col(rc[3:0]), .key(key));\n    sevenSegDigits digits (.clk(clk), .reset(reset), .en(en), .key(key), .s1(s1), .s2(s2));\n    timeMultiplexer timeMux (.clk(clk), .reset(reset), .an1(an1), .an2(an2), .signal(signal));\n    sevenSegMux segMux (.s1(s1), .s2(s2), .enable(signal), .out(current_seg));\n    sevenSegmentDisplay segDisplay (.s(current_seg), .seg(seg));\nendmodule\n\n\n\nTestbench Simulation and Testing\n\nTestbench Design and Results\nTo test my code and see whether it would work as expected, I created a testbench to test before moving on to using physical hardware. I created a testbench for each of my eight modules, testing a different functionality of this lab with east testbench. For the synchronizer submodule, I tested the ability to synchronize and provide a stable output from a asynchronous input. For the keypadFSM submodule, I tested the state transitions and ensured that based on the right inputs, the right outputs would be given. For the keypad submodule, I tested the decoding from a row and column input to a 4 bit number. For the sevenSegDigits submodule, I tested the functionality of switching numbers on the display, based on the inputs given. For the timeMultiplexer submodule, I tested the sequential logic that occurs in this submodule to check that the submodule switches between turning on each common anode on the dual 7-segment display, and correctly outputs the right signal for the sevenSegMux to use. For the sevenSegMux submodule, I tested that the mux would output the right 4 bit value from the two 4 bit inputs, based on whether the enable was on or off. For the sevenSegmentDisplay submodule, I tested all 16 possible 4 bit inputs and made sure that the 7 bit output was correct. For the top level lab3_cw module, it was used to test that the HSOSC module worked, by sampling a few different test cases and making sure that the dual 7-segment display would show both of the values by switching between outputting each one.\nEach of the testbenches were done by using the stim/assert method, to ensure functionality automatically, without having to analyze the waveforms carefully to see if it worked or not.\n\nsynchronizer_testbench results:\nThis testbench tested the ability to synchronize an asynchronous input and provide a stable output.

After referencing the HDSP-521A Seven Segment Display Datasheet, I found that the forward voltage for the display is 1.7 V. Given that we are using a 3.3 V source voltage from the FPGA, the voltage across the resistor is 1.6 V. We need to keep the current under 8 mA, which is the maximum for our ice40, so to keep it clean, I used 220 Ohm Resistors, giving a current of 7.3 mA.\n2N3906 Transistor Base Resistor Value\nWe are supplying 3.3 V to our 2N3906 PNP Transistor. We know from the data sheetthat the Base Emitter Voltage is around 0.7, so we have 2.6 V that will be dropped through the resistor that connects the base to the GPIO Pin. From the iice40 Datasheet, we know from Table 4.17 that I_OL = 8 mA. Thus, we know that we want the current to be between 1 and 8 mA. I chose to use a 1 k Ohm resistor, which gives a current of 2.6 mA, giving ample wiggle room on both ends. Below is a picture that models this math:\n\n\n\nTransistor Resistor Value Math\n\n\n\n\nResults\nAfter finishing with the design, I was able to wire my board according to the schematic and programming my top level module, lab3_cw, onto my board. I was able to physically verify that everything worked as expected.\nBelow is a video demonstrating this lab working successfully:\n\n\nVideo\nSuccessful Keypad Decoder\n\n\nAs a result, my design and project has met all the requirements for this lab."

    "text": "AI Prototype\n\nPrompt 1\nTo test how AI would do for this lab, I entered the following prompt to Claude AI:\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA with internal high-speed oscillator (~20 MHz).\nWrite synthesizable SystemVerilog to scan a 4x4 matrix keypad and display the last two hex keys pressed on a dual 7‑segment display. Implement:\n* A clock divider that derives a scan clock on the order of 100–200 Hz from the internal oscillator.\n* A keypad scanning controller that iterates one active‑low column at a time and samples active‑low rows, registering at most one key per press (debounce‑by‑design), ignoring additional presses while any key is held, and allowing a new registration only after release.\n* A top level that updates two hex digits (older and most recent) when a new key is registered and drives a time‑multiplexed two‑digit 7‑segment display without visible flicker and with balanced brightness.\nUse idiomatic SystemVerilog (e.g., logic, always_ff, enumerated states for FSMs). Provide clean module boundaries and keep all state synchronous. Include brief comments explaining the design choices.\n\nAI Code\nAs a result, it returned the following code:\n// Top-level module for 4x4 keypad scanner with dual 7-segment display\n// Targets Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA with ~20 MHz internal oscillator\nmodule keypad_display_top (\n    input  logic       clk,           // ~20 MHz internal oscillator\n    input  logic       rst_n,         // Active-low reset\n    \n    // Keypad interface (active-low)\n    output logic [3:0] col_n,         // Column outputs (active-low)\n    input  logic [3:0] row_n,         // Row inputs (active-low, pulled up)\n    \n    // 7-segment display interface\n    output logic [6:0] seg_n,         // 7-segment outputs (active-low)\n    output logic [1:0] dig_sel_n      // Digit select (active-low)\n);\n\n    // Internal signals\n    logic scan_clk;

Claude was able to synthesize properly and it seems like it would actually work quite well, which is really impressive. I would need to add the HSOSC module to be able to utilize the FPGA’s onboard clock to run this. But overall, it worked quite well\n\n\n\nModular Prompts\nI then ran the second prompt by using modular prompts. I used the following prompts:\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA.\n\nOverall Goal: Write SystemVerilog to scan a 4x4 matrix keypad and display the last two hex keys pressed on a dual 7 segment display.\n\nCurrent Goal: Write a synthesizable SystemVerilog module that produces a one‑shot registration signal for the keypad system. Behavior:\n\nWhen a key press is first detected, capture the current key code and assert a single‑cycle “new key” pulse.\nWhile any key remains pressed, do not accept additional keys.\nOnly after keys are released should a subsequent press be recognized.\nThis should handle debouncing of the keys.\nImplement as a small synchronous FSM with enumerated states and glitch‑free outputs. Keep names and interfaces reasonable; do not assume any hidden modules beyond what you define here\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA.\n\nWrite a synthesizable SystemVerilog module that cycles through keypad columns (active‑low, one at a time) and samples rows (active‑low) to detect a single key at a time. Behavior:\n\nIterate columns at a suitable scan rate derived from the divided clock and sample rows.\nWhen a key is detected, report a stable key code consistent with a standard 4x4 keypad layout and maintain it while the key remains pressed.\nProvide a boolean signal indicating whether any key is currently pressed.\nUse clean state encoding and synchronous logic; avoid combinational feedback and latches.\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA with internal oscillator as the root clock source.\n\nWrite a top‑level SystemVerilog module that instantiates the scanner and one‑shot modules, shifts the last two keys (older ← most recent; most recent ← new), and drives a multiplexed two‑digit seven‑segment display. Requirements:\n\nUpdate the displayed digits only when a new key is registered.\nEnsure equal apparent brightness and no visible flicker.\nKeep all logic synthesizable and synchronous; use idiomatic SystemVerilog constructs.\nProvide any small clock‑enable or divider logic you need. You can also assume that a sevenSegment module exists that takes a 4 bit input and outputs the 7 segments.\n\nAI Code Result\nClaude gave me the following code.\nmodule keypad_oneshot (\n    input  logic        clk,\n    input  logic        rst_n,\n    input  logic        key_valid,     // From keypad scanner - high when any key detected\n    input  logic [3:0]  key_code,      // From keypad scanner - current key code\n    \n    output logic        new_key_pulse, // Single-cycle pulse when new key registered\n    output logic [3:0]  captured_key   // Stable key code output\n);\n\n    // FSM States\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE        = 2'b00,  // No key pressed, ready for new press\n        DEBOUNCE    = 2'b01,  // Key detected, debouncing\n        KEY_HELD    = 2'b10,  // Key validated and held, waiting for release\n        RELEASE_DEB = 2'b11   // Key released, debouncing release\n    } state_t;\n    \n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    \n    // Debounce counter - adjust DEBOUNCE_COUNT based on your clock frequency\n    // For 12MHz clock, 240 cycles = ~20us debounce time\n    localparam int DEBOUNCE_COUNT = 240;\n    localparam int COUNTER_WIDTH = $clog2(DEBOUNCE_COUNT + 1);\n    \n    logic [COUNTER_WIDTH-1:0] debounce_counter;\n    logic debounce_done;\n    logic [3:0] key_code_reg;\n    \n    // Debounce counter logic\n    assign debounce_done = (debounce_counter == DEBOUNCE_COUNT);\n    \n    always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n        if (!rst_n) begin\n            debounce_counter &lt;= '0;\n        end else begin\n            case (current_state)\n                IDLE: begin\n                    if (key_valid) begin\n                        debounce_counter &lt;= 1;

- c:/users/chris/onedrive/desktop/wu-e155-lab3/e155-lab3/lab3_aiprototype2/source/impl_1/keypad_top.sv(18): instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC. VERI-1063 [keypad_top.sv:18]    \nI then changed this from SB_HFOSC to HSOSC and it was able to synthesize\n\n\n\nReflection\nI am overall very impressed with how AI performed. I learned that Claude is able to write much cleaner code than me, avoiding redundancies and having everything fit in just one module. While this is helpful here, it might not be helpful for testbenching purposes, but I think if I gave AI the right prompts, it would modify my code to make it more testbench friendly and also write the testbenches for me.\nHowever, I think that using a modular structure is much better, being able to outline the way you want your code to run and giving the AI more specific prompts can help it give you code that works well. Using a one module approach is difficult for testing and debugging, and splitting it up makes it both easier for the user and for the AI, so be able to systematically work part by part.\nWhat I learned here, is how important it is to be very precise with prompting AI. The prompts that are given to us to give to AI are very precise in terminology and what we want the AI to do, leaving no room for unnecessary misinterpretation that causes the code to not work. Thus, by giving well written prompts, we are able to get AI to give us exactly what we want and make it work.\nOnce again, I am very impressed with Claude and I can see how useful it will be for the final project."

    "text": "I took this course for a few reasons. First, I think that Hardware Engineering is a future career path for me, and something that I want to pursue long term. It is a good intersection between challenging problem solving that can impact billions of people around the world and my passion for electronics and computing. When I took E85 last year with Prof. Harris, I really enjoyed working on the labs, while sometimes challenging, it was really rewarding to see a project of mine come to fruition. I’ve chosen to take this course in my Junior year, in hopes that it will open up opportunities for internships in Hardware Engineeering. I would like to use my last summer of internships to be able to decide what career I would like to pursue after graduating from Mudd next year.\nThis semester, I would like to be able to absorb as much knowledge as I can, learning new techniques and ways to deal with software and hwardware. I think the nature of this class and the difficulty associated with it will also push me to learn some intangible skills that can be applied in my post-Mudd life. The tenacity and perseverance through challenging labs that aren’t going my way, and the ability to work more efficiently and under a time constraint to complete the labs on time every week will be valuable to being able to meet deadlines and tackle challenging real world problems in the industry.\nI look forward to a great semester of learning!"
